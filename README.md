Tensorflow Chat-bot in Godot


Overview
--------

The goal was to implement a tensorflow chatbot in Godot.

The execution is raw, and there is a lot of optizming to do yet but it's working in stable condition.

I'm still new to Python and Godot in general, so this is an excellent way for me to learn some more about both!
